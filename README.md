# space-invaders
This was a small project that I did for the 2nd year CS module I took at Stellenbosch University. It is a basic game of
space invaders and could be improved upon in basically every way imaginable. The engine used is also super rudimentary
and doesn't allow for complex animations.

The engine is taken from the [Princeton CS stdlib.jar](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
